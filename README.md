## Installation notes:

1. 	Download the last repository as a zip
2.	Unpack the LiveMapPlugin.js and the LiveMap folder with the livemap.js into the web server plugins folder (..fm-dx-webserver-main\plugins)
3. 	Restart the server
4. 	Activate the plugin it in the settings
5.	Read the LiveMapQuickGuide.pdf

## Configuration options:

The following variables can be changed in the header of the script:

    ConsoleDebug = false;        // Activate/Deactivate console output	
    FMLIST_OM_ID = '';           // If you want to use the logbook function, enter your OM ID here, e.g., FMLIST_OM_ID = '1234'
    PSTRotatorFunctions = false; // If you use the PSTRotator plugin, you can activate the control here (default = false)
    const updateInfo = true;     // Enable or disable version check

## Important notes: 

- In order to display the position correctly, your own coordinates must be entered in the web server!
- An initial display occurs as soon as a first PI code has been recognized. The display is further specified upon receipt of a station ID and updated dynamically as changes occur.
- The position of the pop-up window can be changed by pressing the edge and moving the window. You can resize the window by pressing and dragging the blue square in the bottom right corner.
- The frequency table can be shown and hidden using the red square.
- Clicking on the green player symbol opens the link to the live stream (FMSCAN login required).
- Clicking on the location shows all programs at the location, clicking again returns. The frequency displayed in the location list can be clicked directly.
- To move the web server horizontally, press and hold the LiveMap button and drag and drop!
- Click on the web server's frequency display to quickly jump to the previous frequency or toggle between two frequencies, press and hold the left mouse button to deactivate/activate the display
- For authenticated station: Click TX Location to directly open the fmscan.org website with more information (FMSCAN login required)
- To use the FMLIST logbook direct link feature, please enter your OMID in the header of the script!
- If the PSTRotator function is activated in the header, you can rotate the rotor in that direction by clicking on the station name
- When GPS data is received, the location is updated dynamically (GPS receiver and [GPS plugin](https://github.com/Highpoint2000/GPS) required!)
